I'm software engineer with a great deal of passion for software development, constantly striving to extend my knowledge and my view on problem solving, always looking for opportunities to develop myself.

As a software engineer I engage myself to deliver quality on time and I guide my fellow team members to do the same. Every problem (bugs in libraries being used, ill-defined requirements etc.) encountered during this process I categorize under this responsibility.

I also participate in research and planning for the future of the project. I'm keen on investigating new problem domains and making well informed decisions.

Aside from development, I'm also interested in the development process. I've played an essential part in introducing build automation, source control, code review etc. to improve the workflow and the quality of the projects I've worked on. Aside from setting this up I also train my fellow team members in using newly introduced tools.
